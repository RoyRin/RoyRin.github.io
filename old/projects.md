## **2021**

### [Foundations of Blockchain](https://timroughgarden.github.io/fob21/)
* [Handwritten Course Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YmF_3DCrV50MY2pPnB5QPjDwtZOQ4J4N?usp=sharing) for course by Professor Tim Roughgarden

* [Final Project - Privacy when Everyone is Watching: Privacy on the Blockchain](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/985). Co-authored with Nilaksh Agarwal.
    * A medium-depth dive into zk-SNARKs and into privacy coins. 

### [Neural Networks Course](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~zemel/Class/Nndl/)
* Final Project - Improvements and Analysis of Private Ensemble-Based Federated Learning. (available upon requests)
   * An analysis of ensemble-based federated learning like [PATE](http://www.cleverhans.io/privacy/2018/04/29/privacy-and-machine-learning.html) and [CaPC](http://www.cleverhans.io/2021/05/01/capc.html). I studied the use of reputation-based weighting for improved robustness, and conducted a security analysis of the trust assumptions in ensemble-based federated learning.

### Policy for Privacy Technology
  * Course by Professor Rachel Cummings
  * [Final Project]({{site.url}}/assets/projects/courses/privacy_policy_2021/privacy_policy_final.pdf)
    * An investigation of the interplay of Know-Your-Customer (KYC) laws, and privacy-coins on the blockchain. 
  * [MPC explainer]({{site.url}}/assets/projects/courses/privacy_policy_2021/MPC_explainer_share.pdf)
    * An explainer document on a form of "Secure Multi-Party Computation" (MPC); what it is, why it's useful, and how it can be used. Co-written with Sofia Calatrava.

### Arxiv Crawler

I wanted to applied to academic programs, but didn't know a lot about what different academics do, and who is related to whom. So I wrote a basic crawler to scrape arxiv and interactively visualize related authors. Here is the [github link](https://github.com/RoyRin/arxiv_connections).

## **2018** 
### Raspberry PI IOT : smart home project

To truly embrace living in NYC, I rented an apartment where my room did not have a window. I quickly realized that I hated this (obviously), and in order to cope, I made my Raspberry Pi control my sound and lights system to mimic the sun. Here is the [github link](https://github.com/RoyRin/rpi_home_lights).

## **2017** 
### Semantics Review paper

For a graduate course Semantics course (with professor Anna Szabolsci) I wrote a review paper of the use of Natural Logic in Natural Language Inference (NLI). Here's [my review paper]({{site.url}}/assets/projects/courses/semantics_2017/Rinberg_Natural_Logic_in_Natural_Language_Inferences.pdf) and [my presentation]({{site.url}}/assets/projects/courses/semantics_2017/Natural_Logic_present2.pdf).

### Physics Simulations:

As part of my physics education, I would regularly make CS simulations of physics problems, some of which can be found on my [github](https://github.com/RoyRin/Computational_Physics_2016).
