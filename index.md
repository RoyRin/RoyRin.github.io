Welcome to my site. I'm Roy Rinberg. 

I'm a software engineer and computer scientist interested in ways to use technology for positive social change - most recently, I'm interested in privacy technology.


*My current thoughts mostly revolve around:*

1. The intersection of technology and tech-policy. In particular: 
    1. How can we make better ways for people to "hedge" in the tech industry. Or in other words, how can people (like me) effectively do something *good* for the world, while also building general [career capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/). 
    2. What are problems in the world which require truly technical solutions (*are there any?*).
2. How to *effectively* engage with the Effective Altruism community.
3. Climbing.
