Welcome to my site. I'm Roy Rinberg. I'm interested in ways to use technology for positive social change - most recently, I'm interested in <span class="spoiler"> privacy</span> technology. I'm currently a Harvard PhD student, working with Professor [Seth Neel](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1326892) and Professor [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu) on "Trustworthy" Machine Learning.





###  **My current technical thoughts revolve around:**

1. Tools and frameworks for making private computation possible (particularly in a machine-learning systems environment).
2. Laws (primarily US laws) that incentivize technical forms of privacy for developers and disincentivize privacy leaks by companies.

### **The rest of my thoughts mostly revolve around:**

1. The intersection of technology and tech-policy. In particular: how can we make better ways for people to "hedge" in the tech industry. Or in other words, how can people (like me) do something *good* for the world, while also building general [career capital](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/p/we-need-better-hedgeshtml). 
2. ~~Climbing.~~ ~~Triathloning!~~  ~~Climbing again!~~ Triathloning (I never doubted you)

### **Communities I am/have-been a part of**

I created and organize the group Technically Private ([www.technicallyprivate.com](www.technicallyprivate.com)); a group of *mostly* graduate students across many universities, who talk about Privacy and Security. If you're interested in joining - send a request to the above link.

Previously, I was a Master's student at Columbia, conducting research with [Professor Rachel Cummings](https://www.rachelcummings.com) and [Professor Steven Bellovin](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/) on Private Machine Learning. And before that I worked at [Ouster](www.ouster.com), a lidar company, as a software engineer. 

### **Writing:**
I'm a big proponent of [learning in public] and I intend to use this website as a platform for fleshing out my own ideas, while also giving you an idea of what it's like inside my brain.  I write about public-interest tech and privacy on this website and [substack](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/)! I sometimes write on Medium too : [https://royrinberg.medium.com/](https://royrinberg.medium.com/).

### **My hobbies:**
1. Triathloning
2. Reading (or honestly, listening to audiobooks).
3. I'd like to write more, so... writing!
4. Drone Photography
5. ~~Climbing~~
6. ~~Frisbee~~
