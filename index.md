Welcome to my site. I'm Roy Rinberg. I'm interested in ways to use technology for positive social change - most recently, I'm interested in <span class="spoiler"> privacy</span> technology. I'm currently a Harvard PhD student, working with Professor [Seth Neel](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1326892) and Professor [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu) on "Trustworthy" Machine Learning.



### **Being helpful**

I enjoy communicating my work and talking with individuals who want to learn more about computer science research and academia. As someone who pivoted from industry to academia, I'm particularly sympathetic to the difficulties in such a transition; so especially if you're in industry and trying to enter academia, please don't hesitate to reach out. I also help Ukrainian students applying to universities here through a very well-run organization: [MentorUkraine](https://mentorukraine.bravegeneration.org).

I maintain:

* [This Resource List for Working in Public-Interest Technology](https://royrinberg.medium.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712)


###  **My current thoughts revolve around:**

1. Tools and frameworks for making private computation possible (particularly in a machine-learning systems environment).
2. Laws (primarily US laws) that incentivize technical forms of privacy for developers and disincentivize privacy leaks by companies.
3. The intersection of technology and tech-policy. In particular: how can we make better ways for people to "hedge" in the tech industry. Or in other words, how can people (like me) do something *good* for the world, while also building general [career capital](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/p/we-need-better-hedgeshtml). 
4. ~~Climbing.~~ ~~Triathloning!~~  ~~Climbing again!~~ Triathloning (I never doubted you)

### **Communities I am/have-been a part of**

I created and organize the group [Technically Private](https://www.technicallyprivate.com); a group of *mostly* graduate students across many universities, who talk about Privacy and Security. If you're interested in joining - send a request to the above link.

Previously, I was a Master's student at Columbia, conducting research with [Professor Rachel Cummings](https://www.rachelcummings.com) and [Professor Steven Bellovin](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/) on Private Machine Learning. And before that I worked at [Ouster](www.ouster.com), a lidar company, as a software engineer. 

### **Writing:**
I'm a big proponent of [learning in public].  I sometimes write about public-interest tech and privacy on [substack](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/) or [Medium](https://royrinberg.medium.com/).

### **My hobbies:**
2. Reading (or honestly, listening to audiobooks).
3. I'd like to write more, so... [writing](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/)!
4. [Drone Photography](https://royrinberg.com/Hobbies/)
5. ~~Frisbee~~ ~~Climbing~~ Triathloning
8. Collecting a [list of how organizations advertise privacy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wArCxGAAvkJcy0inWeKua3Ra7LkJDhApcso8cJ1Aon8/edit#slide=id.g1223166de6e_0_7) (if you have more, please send them to me!)
