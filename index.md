Welcome to my site. I'm Roy Rinberg. You can find my substack newsletter here : [https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/)!


### **Who am I? (at a high-level)**
I'm a computer scientist and software engineer interested in ways to use technology for positive social change - most recently, I'm interested in <span class="spoiler"> privacy</span> technology.

I'm currently a Master's student at Columbia, conducting research with [Professor Rachel Cummings](https://www.rachelcummings.com) and [Professor Steven Bellovin](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/) on Private Machine Learning. I am partially supported by the Advanced Master's Research Specialization award at Columbia. 

I created and organize the group [Technically Private](https://groups.google.com/g/technically-private); a group of *mostly* graduate students across many universities, who talk about Privacy and Security. If you're interested in joining - send a request to the above link.

I'm a big proponent of [learning in public] and I intend to use this website as a platform for fleshing out my own ideas, while also giving you an idea of what it's like inside my brain.  I write about public-interest tech and privacy on this website and [substack](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/)! I sometimes write on Medium too : [https://royrinberg.medium.com/](https://royrinberg.medium.com/).




###  **My current technical thoughts revolve around:**

1. Tools for making private computation possible (particularly in a machine-learning systems environment).
2. Laws (primarily US laws) that incentivize technical forms of privacy for developers and disincentivize privacy leaks by companies.

### **The rest of my thoughts mostly revolve around:**

1. The intersection of technology and tech-policy. In particular: 
    1. How can we make better ways for people to "hedge" in the tech industry. Or in other words, how can people (like me) effectively do something *good* for the world, while also building general [career capital](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital/). 
    2. What are problems in the world which require truly technical solutions (*are there any?*).  
2. How to *effectively* engage with the Effective Altruism community.
3. ~~Climbing.~~ ~~Triathloning!~~  ~~Climbing again! ~~ Triathloning (I never doubted you)


### **My hobbies:**
1. Triathloning
2. Climbing
3. Reading (or honestly, listening to audiobooks).
4. I'd like to write more, so... writing!
5. Drone Photography
6. ~~ Frisbee ~~
