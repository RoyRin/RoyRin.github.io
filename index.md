I'm Roy Rinberg. I'm interested in [public-interest technology](https://royrinberg.medium.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712) - most recently, I'm interested in <span class="spoiler"> privacy</span> technology. I'm a Harvard PhD student, advised by Professor [Seth Neel](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1326892) and Professor [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu) on "Trustworthy" Machine Learning.


### **Being helpful**

I enjoy communicating my work and talking with individuals who want to learn more about computer science research and academia. As someone who pivoted from industry to academia, I'm particularly sympathetic to the difficulties in such a transition; so especially if you're in industry and trying to enter academia, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

I also help young Ukrainian students applying to universities, with [MentorUkraine](https://mentorukraine.bravegeneration.org).

I maintain:

* [This Resource List for Working in Public-Interest Technology](https://royrinberg.medium.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712)


### **Communities/groups I have been a part of**


* I created and organize the group [Technically Private](https://www.technicallyprivate.com): a group of *mostly* graduate students across many universities, who talk about Privacy and Security. If you're interested in joining - send a request to the above link.
* CS Research Master's at Columbia: I conducted research with [Professor Rachel Cummings](https://www.rachelcummings.com) and [Professor Steven Bellovin](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/) on Private ML. 
* I was an early-stage software engineer for 3 years at [Ouster](www.ouster.com), a lidar company. 


### **Writing:**
I'm a big proponent of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).  I sometimes write about public-interest tech and privacy on [substack](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/) or [Medium](https://royrinberg.medium.com/).



### **My hobbies:**
2. Reading (or honestly, listening to audiobooks).
3. I'd like to write more, so... [writing](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/)!
4. [Drone Photography](https://github.com/RoyRin/RoyRin.github.io/tree/master/assets/drone_photos) 
5. ~~Frisbee~~ ~~Climbing~~ Triathloning
8. Collecting a [list of how organizations advertise privacy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wArCxGAAvkJcy0inWeKua3Ra7LkJDhApcso8cJ1Aon8/edit#slide=id.g1223166de6e_0_7) (if you have more, please send them to me!)
