## Projects 
* [Privacy When Everyone is Watching : Privacy on the Blockchain in the Presence of KYC laws]({{site.url}}/assets/projects/courses/privacy_policy_2021/privacy_policy_final.pdf)
* [Multi-party Computation (MPC) and Trustless Wage Sharing explainer ]({{site.url}}/assets/projects/courses/privacy_policy_2021/privacy_policy_hw3.pdf)

## Academic Community Work
* I lead a group of cross-university graduate students who meet and discuss privacy and security from technical, legal, and policy perspectives. We are called [Technically Private](https://groups.google.com/g/technically-private/) (though informally sometimes go by Privacy Peeps). Please reach out if you are interested in joining.
