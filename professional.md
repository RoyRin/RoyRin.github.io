## Academic Community Work
* I lead a group of cross-university graduate students who meet and discuss privacy and security from technical, legal, and policy perspectives. We are called [Technically Private](https://groups.google.com/g/technically-private/) (though informally sometimes go by Privacy Peeps). Please reach out if you are interested in joining.
