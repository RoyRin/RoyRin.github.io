<p>Project Building Excitement for Science and Technology (<a href= "www.theprojectbest.org"> Project BEST</a>); CFO and Co-Founder; 2011-2014 </p>
<blockquote>
Project BEST (Building Excitement for Science and Technology), Project BEST is a non-profit organization with the goal of helping middle school students become interesting science and technology. Alongside 4 peers, Parth Chopra, Nikhil Garg, Robert Young, and Dhruv Gaba, we developed Project BEST from the ground up. During my 3 years, we interacted with >3,000 students. (www.theprojectbest.org), created 23 chapters across 3 different states, and produced 2 iterations of an annual day-long event for ~120 students each time (SCI2YC : Science Innovation and Inspiration Youth Conference). We organized Project BEST to be run by High School students, and carefully structured our organizational design to take in newer, younger people. In 2014, the original team took our hands off the reigns, and Project BEST has continued to run smoothly. 
</blockquote>
<p> University Honors Leadeship Course</p>
<blockquote> Course taught by Professor Diane Yu. We met with leaders like Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, Serial Restauranteur Danny Meyers, President of NYC Philharmonic Matthew VanBeisen, and traveled to West Point. </blockquote>
