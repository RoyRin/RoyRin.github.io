### **Who am I? (at a high-level)**
I'm a computer-scientist/software-engineer/generally-curious-person. I generally align with [effective-altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) ideas, but lately I've been trying to actually make them into effective altruism actions. 

I graduated from NYU with a degree in Physics and Computer Science and a minor in Math in 2018. I worked at [Ouster] as a software engineer, first as an intern and then as a full-time employee, until July 2021. I'm now attending Columbia University where I'll be trying to study the intersection of computer science and society, from a highly technical perspective. While it's somewhat of a hard-pivot, I'm interested in moving into privacy, decentralization, and computer-science mechanisms that embed human values like recourse, fairness, and (possibly) interpretability.


I'm a big proponent of [learning in public] and I intend to use this website as a platform for fleshing out my own ideas, while also giving you an idea of what it's like inside my brain. 

### **Why am I going to Columbia?**

I like a lot of different things, and unfortunately, time is limited and I can't do everything. Columbia is an experiment for me to beta test a few ideas, so that I can better figure out what I want to hone in on. I will use this blog to post somewhat regularly on progress on my three experiments.

I intend to do a hard pivot from the more physics-y and performance-based computer science work I've been doing into something more related to the intersection of tech and society (some might call this [public-interest technology](https://blog.usejournal.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712?gi=ca4d625feb55)).

In my time at Columbia I aim to explore a key hypothesis that I've been developing over the last ~3 years:
there are very few technical problems in the world. I intend to blog about this more regularly, so if you find this underwhelming, stay tuned, I'll be blogging and expressing my thoughts more regularly.

I intend to use my time at Columbia to do 3 things:
1. Become a better (software) engineer, specifically taking a few more systems engineering courses, and then also learning more data-science and machine learning (*oOoOo jazz hands oOOooO*).
2. Explore academic research, specifically in privacy and potentially also law. If not that, then looking at transparency tools for algorithmic decision making systems, measuring things like recourse, interpretability, and robustness.
3. (Perhaps most orthogonal to what a CS masters is traditionally supposed to get you...) Explore working on tech policy. I aim to work with professors and students at the Columbia Policy school, the Columbia Law School, and orgs like the Knight First Amendment Institute. I want to build connections and learn how I can leverage my highly technical background to work on tech policy.

*Potential outcomes I forsee at the end of my experiment:*

1. software engineer: ideally in a role related to privacy, fairness, or possibly even security
2. doing a PhD. In particular at a place that focuses either on the intersection of CS and the law, or econ and CS. I have a pretty in-depth list, so if this interests you, feel free to reach out.
3. a tech policy adviser: possibly in a think tank like RAND, Open Phil Tech Fellow, or Aspen Fellowship.

Note to myself (and to you): I intend to further write out potential plans that could be fleshed out here.

### **My hobbies:**
1. Climbing
2. reading (or honestly, listening to audiobooks). Here's my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68424670-roy).
3. I'd like to write more, so... an aspirational hobby is writing
4. Frisbee
