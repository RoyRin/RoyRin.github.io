I'm Roy Rinberg. I'm a CS PhD student at Harvard, and I'm largely interested in <span class="spoiler"> privacy</span> technology and "Trustworthy" Machine Learning. I'm advised by Professor [Salil Vadhan](https://salil.seas.harvard.edu) and Seth Neel. And I'm broadly interested in [public-interest technology](https://royrinberg.medium.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712).


I maintain:
* [This google sheet of Academic Privacy researchers in North America](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-M6Tv94S9Oa07D3ehzVkeRIAsktuIpC4hDO7gGf1ous/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
* [This Resource List for Working in Public-Interest Technology](https://royrinberg.medium.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712)
* [Here's a guide on using Slurm](https://fascinated-zircon-5bc.notion.site/FASRC-Computing-1c14c3845c4c8046bbd6f2bac85fc067) with an associated [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pak8OOLDNkQ)
* [Here are (aggressive) steps I've taken to be less addicted to the internet](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11ZJdjvSWC22nw8pm7j8gEiv8ZjuhaDv9klX1x3hzmC0/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p)



### **Writing:**
I'm a big proponent of [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).  I sometimes write about public-interest tech and privacy on [substack](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/) or [Medium](https://royrinberg.medium.com/).



### **Being helpful**

I enjoy communicating my work and talking with individuals who want to learn more about computer science research and academia. As someone who pivoted from industry to academia, I'm particularly sympathetic to the difficulties in such a transition; so especially if you're in industry and trying to enter academia, please don't hesitate to reach out. 

I used to help young Ukrainian students applying to universities, with [MentorUkraine](https://mentorukraine.bravegeneration.org). I strongly recommend this organization.

### **Communities/groups I have been a part of**


* I created and organize the group [Technically Private](https://www.technicallyprivate.com): a group of *mostly* graduate students across many universities, who talk about Privacy and Security. If you're interested in joining - send a request to the above link.
* CS Research Master's at Columbia: I conducted research with [Professor Rachel Cummings](https://www.rachelcummings.com) and [Professor Steven Bellovin](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~smb/) on Private ML. 
* I was an early-stage software engineer for 3 years at [Ouster](www.ouster.com), a lidar company. 

### **My hobbies:**
3. [Writing, ideally](https://technicallyprivate.substack.com/)!
4. [Drone Photography](https://github.com/RoyRin/RoyRin.github.io/tree/master/assets/drone_photos), but uploading the photos is such a pain
5. ~~Frisbee~~ ~~Climbing~~ ~~Triathloning~~ [Bike Polo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcourt_Bike_Polo)
8. Collecting a [list of how organizations advertise privacy](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wArCxGAAvkJcy0inWeKua3Ra7LkJDhApcso8cJ1Aon8/edit#slide=id.g1223166de6e_0_7) (if you have more, please send them to me!)
