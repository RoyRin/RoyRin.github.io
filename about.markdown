I am a Russian-Israeli-American software engineer. I graduated from NYU with a degree in Physics and Computer Science and a minor in Math in 2018. I worked at [Ouster] as a software engineer, first as an intern and then as a full-time employee, until July 2021. I'm now attending Columbia University where I'll be trying to study the intersection of computer science and society, from a highly technical perspective. 


In my time at Columbia I aim to explore a key hypothesis that I've been developing over the last ~3 years:
there are effectively very few technical problems in the world.
## TODO : finish this page

I intend to use my time at Columbia to do 3 things:

1. become a better (software) engineer, specifically taking a few more systems engineering courses, and then also learning more data-science and machine learning (oooo jazz hands ooo).
2. explore research specifically in privacy 


I intend to do a hard pivot from the more physics-y and performance-based computer science work I've been doing  

I'm a big proponent of [learning in public] and I intend to use this website as a platform for fleshing out my own ideas, while also giving you an idea of what it's like inside my brain.
