### **My Path**

I graduated from NYU with a degree in Physics and Computer Science and a minor in Math in 2018. I worked at [Ouster] as a software engineer, first as an intern and then as a full-time employee. After Ouster went public, I left in July 2021, and I'm now attending Columbia University where I'll be trying to study the intersection of computer science and society, from a highly technical perspective. While it's somewhat of a hard-pivot, I'm interested in moving into privacy, decentralization, and computer-science mechanisms. I also generally align with [effective-altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) ideas, and lately I've been trying to actually make them into effective altruism actions. 


### **Why did I decide to go to Columbia?**

I like a lot of different things, and unfortunately, time is limited and I can't do everything. Columbia is an experiment for me to beta test a few ideas, so that I can better figure out what I want to hone in on. I will use this blog to post somewhat regularly on progress on my three experiments.

I intend to do a hard pivot from the more physics-y and performance-based computer science work I've been doing into something more related to the intersection of tech and society (some might call this [public-interest technology](https://blog.usejournal.com/resources-for-working-in-public-interest-technology-78a74e7fd712?gi=ca4d625feb55)).

In my time at Columbia I aim to explore a key hypothesis that I've been developing over the last ~3 years:
there are very few technical problems in the world. I intend to blog about this more regularly, so if you find this underwhelming, stay tuned, I'll be blogging and expressing my thoughts more regularly.


## **My academic goals during my Masters at Columbia:**
- [x] Decide if I want a PhD 
  - I do.
- [x] Publish a paper as any author
- [ ] Publish a paper as first author at a top venue. [in review]
- [x] Give a formal talk on my research 
  - Given at [Workshop on Differential Privacy and Statistical Data Analysis](http://www.fields.utoronto.ca/activities/22-23/privacy) on my work on Individualized PATE.
- [x] Improve my understanding of machine learning from a theory and practice perspective.
  - This is an on-going and never-ending task, but I've certainly improved.
- [x] Understand what the blockchain and form nuanced opinions on it.
  - I wrote an [SOK on ZK-SNARKs on the Blockchain](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/985)
  - I have drafted a policy paper on "*Privacy on the Blockchain in the Presence of KYC laws*", please message me if you're interested in a pre-preint.
- [ ] Have more than 100 readers on Substack
- [x] Advise as a technical engineer for a company or startup
  - Served as lead engineer for [Shelton.AI](https://www.sheltonai.com/) for the first 6 months of its starting up.
- [ ] Advise for a privacy company.
- [x] Collaborate with lawyers and write a law review paper relating to a technical topic, in order to identify if this is the path that I want to take. [in review]
- [x] Create a academic community of graduate students with similar interests to mine
  - I created and organize the group [Technically Private](https://groups.google.com/g/technically-private). It's a group of *mostly* graduate students across many universities, who talk about Privacy and Security. If you're interested in joining - send a request to the above link.
