Target Audience: Future Roy.

Life is long, I've only been out of college for about 3 years, but at the same time, we didn't get to the moon by aimlessly trying to work on space-related technologies. We got to the moon because we set a incredibly challenging goal. 
 
To paraphrase Richard Hamming : random-walks are acceptable, but the distance that you travel from your starting point is on average O(\sqrt(n)), where are moving in a straight (ish) line, you travel O(n). I'm 25 and it's 2021. I have 50 years minimum of career ahead of me - I'd like to try to make ~25 years of "progress", not ~7.

## What frame of mind am I coming into Columbia with?

I have some ideas that I need to beta test, and Columbia seems to be my best step forward as a way to beta test them.
**My core thesis:**
The majority of issues in the world are non-technical and largely communication based.

**How could I be wrong about this:**
Some technologies straight up do not exist yet. For example: secure communication protocol robust to quantum factorization, cheap carbon capture, self-driving cars.

**My adapted, slightly more-nuanced thesis:**
Some technologies, particularly those that provide guardrails against other innovations, require increased developed. As an example, I believe privacy and cybersecurity require true technological innovations. To unpack this further, I'd broadly categorize two kinds of innovations, 1. goods/services where the people who pay for the good are the people who benefit from it, and 2. innovation not captured by the martket (market externalities).

I'd argue that innovations in class 1 will be pushed by the [invisible hand](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/invisiblehand.asp) of capitalism, and for those technologies we need to improve regulations (examples of this are : self-driving cars)

Innovations in class 2 will *not* be pushed by the invisible hand, without social movements (a good case-study to explore is Apple and privacy+security), and increased technological advancements here will actually make a strong impact.

To pre-emptively counter-act the "[rising tides lift all boats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rising_tide_lifts_all_boats)" argument about technological improvements in category 1. I think there's clear enough evidence that tech companies in the last 10 years have made a lot of improvements to technical problems and consolidated a lot of wealth, while social systems like IRS loopholes, worker wages, public health insurance, and literal [physical infrastructure](https://infrastructurereportcard.org/cat-item/bridges/) have either plateaued or gotten worse. It would be both coy and more appropriate to say rising tides lift some yachts.

So, my more nuanced thesis is that if I want to work on socially relevant issues, I should direct my resources (specifically my time) at technical problems surrounding some of the following: privacy preserving mechanisms for sharing data, interpretability/robustness/security/recourse of ML models, mechanism design for the allocation of aid. Alternatively, I should work on things that support policy-makers/regulators for issues that fall into category 1.

## What am I trying to test?
I think that there are 3 potential outcomes that I am interested in exploring:

1. Explore academic research. Specifically I intend to explore privacy, mechanism design, some decentralized technology work, or possibly fairness of machine learning. The goal here is to 1. find out if I want to do a PhD (likely at Georgetown or NYU, though any school that I applied to in 2020 is an enticing option). 2. Find out what are alternatives to academia that I could pursue after a PhD. 
2. Perhaps the most orthogonal to what a CS masters traditionally gets you : I am interested in exploring tech policy while at Columbia. This is the idea that is most exciting to me, but I also know the least about. People like Tara Wheeler, Chris Seghoian, Daniel Kahn Gilmor, Jon Callus, and Bruce Schneier are people in this space that I would like to emulate. Columbia's Law School, Policy School (SIPA), and other neighboring organizations like the Knight First Amendment Institute are potentially fruitful paths to explore this space. 
3. "back-up plan": am I interested in becoming a better software engineer, and potentially returing to a similar role to the one that I am in now. Calling this a "back-up" is pretty tongue-in-cheek, as there's a lot of ways that I can adapt this to be much more of a progression. For one: I can specifically go work at a different, small-ish, high-growth company where my presence can make a concrete and tangible impact, and my role would not be strictly software engineering.


## Other miscellaneous things that are on my mind:

Big things are happening in the world. Quantum computing, AI, privacy, lidar, robotics, are all progressing incredibly quickly - people make predictions about self-driving cars, TAI (transformational AI), and quantum computing all arriving in the next 5 years. This might be unlikely, but it's possible. It's important to weigh my actions not only in where I think I am now, but in what kind of trajectory I view that the world is going. For my future context, here's [a post that I just read](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Xgy6CAf2jqHhynHL/what-2026-looks-like-daniel-s-median-future) about progress in AI.
I should write up some content about my personal predictions given living in SF, working in the lidar space, being a software engineer, and talking to other EAs.
