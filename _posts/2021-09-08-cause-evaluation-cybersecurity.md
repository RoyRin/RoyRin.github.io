I’m interested in doing a decently hard pivot with my life into the internet privacy (and security) space. Here, I explore, at a very high-level, the scope of the problems in these fields, in order to get a sense of an order-of-magnitude of the problems involved.

In this post, I am looking into:
**What scale of social impact would improvements to policies surrounding internet cybersecurity make?**
I will focus on security because the effects of security are more quantifiable and tangible; and I will save a more indepth analysis of privacy for a later date.

## Fast facts
- The social cost per leaked PII record is around 150-180$ - [IBM data breach report](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach)
- Looking into just the Fintech market (from the [IBM data breach report](https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach)):
    - We can low-ball that there are 5,000 Financial institutions in the US. ([plaid](https://plaid.com/blog/how-many-fis/))
    - Cyber attack stats:
    - Frequency of an attack: 2-4 times per year
    - Likelihood of successful attack: 5% - 15% 
    - 500,000 to 1M- Estimated number of sensitive records in a database 
    - 75 - 100% PII/PCI - Estimated percentage that contain PII
- “4.24m is the average cost of a data breach” 
- “high level of compliance failures [were] associated with breach costs $2.3 million higher than breach costs at organizations without this factor present.” 
    - <ins>We can estimate that strong compliance can decrease costs by ~50%. </ins>

## Context
Current spend on cybersecurity products:
- For 2019, they forecast the market to grow to $124 billion, and $170.4 billion in 2022 ([Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3889055)).
- "By 2020, we expect IT analysts covering cybersecurity will be predicting five-year spending forecasts (to 2025) ([cybersecurity ventures](https://cybersecurityventures.com/cybersecurity-market-report/)). 
- U.S. Government spending on cybersecurity
    - The 2019 U.S. President’s budget includes $15 billion for cybersecurity, a $583.4 million (4.1 percent) increase over 2018. The Department of Defense (DoD) was the largest contributor to the budget. The DoD reported $8.5 billion in cybersecurity funding in 2019, a $340 million (4.2 percent) increase over 2018.

## Estimates
Just for financial data: 
- Low estimate: 2 * 15% * 500k record  * 75% * 180$/record = 6.75 M per org
- Social Cost for Fin-tech : *low-ball* 30 Billion/yr  (a mid-level estimate is 500 Billion).
    - 50% reduction would mean ~30/2 to ~500/2 Billion $ /yr.
    - Even a 10% effect would range from 1.5 Billion to 25 Billion/yr.
- Additionally there are 16 other industries (Public sector, Media..). Potentially multiplying the effect by 17x, to range from **25 to 425 billion per year**.
- And on top of this, security and privacy have trickle down effects like improved democratic processes (e.g. weaker monopolies and stronger elections).

## Evidence that this is still relatively neglected
- Market based argument: cybersecurity has a 0% unemployment rate ([link](https://lifars.com/2021/04/cybersecurity-occupation-hit-a-0-unemployment-rate-we-need-more-experts/))
- Software positions for security experts routinely go unfilled.
- Events like the [Equifax hack (2017)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach) and [SolarWinds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SolarWinds#2019%E2%80%932020_supply_chain_attacks) are occurring regularly ([2020 hacks](https://hacked.com/largest-breaches-and-hacks-of-2020-the-year-of-the-digital-pandemic/)) 
- Cybersecurity market is forecast to be around [$170.4 billion in 2022](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3889055), which is less than the estimate of social benefit of just improving compliance.
- Right now we have a dearth of technical people in policy making. ([Bridging the Gap](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/11/we_must_bridge_the_g.html)).

## How effective could this be?
- Congress is relatively immobile, and the US court system is extremely precedent-based. Any effect on laws + legal cases that occur now will have a strong effect in future laws.
- There is strong momentum now, and we have a lot of laws and court cases coming up ([36 states, D.C. sue Google](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/07/07/36-states-dc-sue-google-for-alleged-antitrust-violations-in-its-android-app-store-498622); [Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/); CCPA; [Virginia passes comprehensive privacy bill](https://www.gibsondunn.com/virginia-passes-comprehensive-privacy-law/)) 

## What can we do (concretely)
- Some top advice right now is simply to “[bridge the gap](https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2019/11/we_must_bridge_the_g.html)” to develop more intelligent policies. OpenPhil can fund getting tech people + policy people talking with one another. 
- Philanthropy organizations like [OpenPhil](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/) can put more resources in programs like its new [tech policy fellows program](https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/technology-policy-fellowship). 
    - See my post on [Better Hedges (in Public Interest-Technology)]({% post_url 2021-09-05-we-need-better-hedges %})

- Orgs like OpenPhil can give grants to orgs to produce more [good standards for security + privacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIST_Cybersecurity_Framework).
- Orgs like [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org/) can support getting tech people working in government, at places like [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/).
- I also think that there is room for the creation of an entirely new organization to get tech people to directly consult for policy people. As a rough cost estimate:
- We can estimate that the average tech employee salary is 200k$ in the US. With 10 employees allocated for each of 50 states, and 50 federal level employees. 550 employees * 200k$ = ~110 million dollars.
- And this is a dramatically larger number than is really needed ([180 employees work at the USDS](https://fcw.com/blogs/lectern/2020/11/kelman-digital-service-growth.aspx?m=1), which has quickly garnered respect in the tech industry and had a positive impact on the US government).
- I’d guess that a moderate systemic change can be created with only 2 employees per state and 10 at the federal level (~22 million dollars per year).
