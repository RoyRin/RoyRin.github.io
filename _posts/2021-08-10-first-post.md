This is my first post on this personal site. I'm a big proponent of [learning in public] and I intend to use this site as a platform for fleshing out my own ideas. At the same time, it might give you an idea of what it's like inside my brain (if you happen to be curious).


## Accomplished Goals:
1. Have a fully functioning Jekyll blog, with some images in it, and
4. link my CV + SWE resume 
2. have it hosted on www.royrinberg.com
2. Write a short post on 1. a summary of my time at Ouster 2. what am I trying to get out from Columbia
3. set up a joint medium + personal blog structure using Jekyll - following this structure : [link](https://jonbake.com/blog/2019/08/02/creating-a-hybrid-jekyll-medium-blog.html)
5. Add ability for comments

## Additional goals for the site

5. Potentially add goodreads widget: [link](https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=widgets)
6. Add a sidebar on each post that will show the table of contents, like this [site](https://os.phil-opp.com/freestanding-rust-binary/)
