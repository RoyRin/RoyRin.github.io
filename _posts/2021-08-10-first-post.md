This is my first post on this personal site. I'm a big proponent of [learning in public] and I intend to use this site as a platform for fleshing out my own ideas. At the same time, it might give you an idea of what it's like inside my brain (if you happen to be curious).
## Goals for this week

2. have it hosted on www.royrinberg.com
2. Write a short post on 1. a summary of my time at Ouster 2. what am I trying to get out from Columbia
3. set up a joint medium + personal blog structure using Jekyll - following this structure : https://jonbake.com/blog/2019/08/02/creating-a-hybrid-jekyll-medium-blog.html
5. add gooodreads widget: https://www.goodreads.com/user/edit?tab=widgets
