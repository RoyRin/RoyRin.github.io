Target Audience: Future Roy.

### High-level goal setting 
### Concrete actions:
#### Intellectual:
  1. I aim to do a thesis in my masters at Columbia, in the intersection of computer science and economics - likely privacy.
  2. Find an actual job/role that I can have in the intersection of computer science + economics/policy-making. Not just the idea of a job, not just the awareness that there is a gap between technologists and policy-makers, concrete actions that I can take.
  
#### Personal
  1. Climb harder. I currently climb at a V5 and 5.11C level, I'd like to bring that up to V7 and 5.12B. I'd also like to learn to lead.
  2. Read more/better. Here's my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68424670-roy). I aim to read at least 25 books per year, ideally 35. And write 2-3 paragraphs from the book as I'm reading.

### Soft intangibles:
#### Intellectual
  1. I'd like to get in the habit at making predictions, and getting better at forecasting. My most concrete action here is to explore forecasting through the EA community, and in particular the prediction software [Foretell](https://www.cset-foretell.com/).
  2. I'd like to get better at [persistence](https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-book/).
  3. I'd like to further explore privacy, as well as how the law concrete intersects with technology. Possibly specifically looking at GDPR, CCPA. I'd like to develop a theory of change surrounding legal and technical progress. This potentially feeds into a PhD (in particular, I'm quite excited by anyone who has went to this conference : https://simons.berkeley.edu/workshops/algorithm-design-and-law).
#### Personal
  1. Get more involved in the EA community. Concrete actions I can take on this front are: I could be an organizer at EA Columbia; I could help teach the EA fellowship; I could apply for the OpenPhil Tech Fellows program; I could apply for the OpenPhil Research Fellows program.
