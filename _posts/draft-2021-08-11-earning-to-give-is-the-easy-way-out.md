My argument is simple. If you take the Effective Altruism claim that you should go do the thing that is most effective (I don't personally think that you should do this). And you look at the
[Charity Entrepreneurship website](https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/about-us.html), they write:
"It is also a highly neglected career opportunity that, fueled by a more analytical effective-altruist mindset, can lead to cost-effective, evidence-based outcomes that are approximately equivalent to ~$200,000 in donations to effective charities per year." If you think that you are not contributing ~200k to whatever causes you believe in, it would make sense for you to transfer what you are doing to founding a charity.
