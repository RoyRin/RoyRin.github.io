## General Browsing
- Browser Extensions
- https://trackmenot.io/



## Browsers and search engines:
- Firefox is much better than chrome for privacy, but I won't advocate too strongly for the "dont use chrome".
- Duckduckgo is also better for privacy, but google search is very good, so do what you want on that front too.


## Chrome Extensions: 
Outside of those 2, I recommend getting these extensions:
1- https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere (this makes all your websites HTTPS
2- I like this free extension : https://trackmenot.io/
which basically goes to random sites in the background so it obfuscates what trackers see
3- use a password manager, and make sure all your passwords are different
4 - referer control (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/referer-control/hnkcfpcejkafcihlgbojoidoihckciin?hl=en) 
    this basically controls what a site can see about where you are coming from ( which helps prevent trackers)
5- outside of that, I use a pretty strong ad-block, which also blocks many trackers - https://adnauseam.io/ . 
    But it was banned on google chrome, so you need to install it manually. It's pretty effective (it works by clicking all the ads and preventing them from opening up on your browser - so it costs advertisers money, and you could think that's immoral).

## Private Activities
Doing specifically private activities:

that said: if you want to do a specific thing, and you want it to be as anonymous as possible, the simplest advice is : use a VPN + Tor

- Tor + a VPN
- blockchains are not private by default. <<< TODO: write a post on this. Use things like Zcash shielded transactions
