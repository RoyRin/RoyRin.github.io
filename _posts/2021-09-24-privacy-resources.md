I've been spinning up on privacy for a little while now, here are some resources I've found helpful:

## Summaries
    
- [OpenDP Documentation](https://docs.opendp.org/en/stable/resources/index.html)
- [DifferentialPrivacy.org](https://differentialprivacy.org/resources/)

## Textbooks

- [The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/Papers/privacybook.pdf)
- [Differential Privacy: From Theory to Practice](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7731575)
- [Programming Differential Privacy](https://programming-dp.com/)

## Blog Series

- [Damien Desfontaine](https://desfontain.es/privacy/differential-privacy-reading-list.html)
- [DifferentialPrivacy.org](https://differentialprivacy.org/)
- [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/applied-cybersecurity/privacy-engineering/collaboration-space/focus-areas/de-id/dp-blog)

## Informal educational materials
- [What is Differential Privacy Basics - Medium](https://becominghuman.ai/what-is-differential-privacy-1fd7bf507049)
## "Formal" Course Materials

- [Joe Near - Programming Differential Privacy](https://jnear.github.io/cs211-data-privacy/) (I really like this one. It's a quick start for programmers)
- [Gautam Kamath](http://www.gautamkamath.com/CS860-fa2020.html)
- [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/courses/privacyF11.html)
- [Jonathan Ullman & Adam Smith](https://dpcourse.github.io/)
- [James Honaker & Salil Vadhan](http://people.seas.harvard.edu/~salil/cs208/spring19/)
- [Marco Gaboardi](http://cs-people.bu.edu/gaboardi/teaching/CSE660-fall17.html)
- [Moni Naor](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/COURSE/foundations_of_privacy.html)


## Non-technical (or less technical) Primers
- [Differential Privacy: A Primer for a Non-Technical Audience](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3338027)
- [Joe Near - Programming Differential Privacy](https://jnear.github.io/cs211-data-privacy/) (This is linked above, it's semi-technical, but it really only requires computer science background, not a mathematical one.)
