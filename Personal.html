            <p>  Linguistics: Semantics Review paper on Natural Logic in Natural Language Inference (NLI)</p>
         <blockquote>
          In fall, 2017, I took a graduate course Semantics 1 with professor Anna Szabolsci, at NYU. As the final project of the class I produced a review paper of the use of Natural Logic in Natural Language Inference (NLI), largely drawing from Bill MacCartney's 2009 thesis (Natural Language Inference) and Ellie Pavlick's 2017 thesis (Compositional Lexical Semantics in Natural Language Inference). I also drew from Larry Moss's work on proof theoretic approaches, as well as other miscellaneous resources (notably Lauri Karttunen's "Natural Logic to Natural Reasoning") on rule-based inference based approaches. Here is my <a href="Documents/Rinberg_Natural_Logic_in_Natural_Language_Inferences.pdf">review paper </a> and my <a href="Documents/Natural_Logic_present2.pdf"> presentation</a>.

        <p>     Raspberry PI IOT : smart home project</p>
        <blockquote> To truly embrace living in NYC, I decided to go all in, and rent an apartment where my room did not have a window. You know, experience a thoroughly depressing existence for a year. But after committing to this, I realized that I hated it (obviously). In order to cope, and prevent my circadian rhythm from going completely haywire, I decided to make my Raspberry Pi control my sound and lights system. <a href = "Documents/RaspberryPiLights.pdf"> Here is a write-up of my project, and how to do it! </a></blockquote>
         <p>     Physics Simulations: </p>
         <blockquote> Some of projects : simulating a chaotic N-body system of planets orbiting with RK-4 and Symplectic integrators on Hamiltonian equations; Modelling chaotic behaviours; Simulating projection of water out of a fountain; Particle in a Box; Optical Tweezers/Trapping graphic and calculation. Here is the github to the majority of my computational physics simulations: <a href="https://github.com/RoyRin/Computational_Physics_2016"> enjoy! </a>.
          <p> Here's a pretty funny (I think) simulation of an N-body simulation - note: energy is in fact conserved</p>

         </blockquote>
          <p>     Code in CS classes: </p>
            <blockquote> Probably the only class worth mentioning really, I wrote a LOT of code for my Algorithmic Problem Solving class with Professor John Zhang. The class website is <a href = "cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring17/CSCI-UA.0480-004/"> here</a> and I did every homework assignment in Java. 
              My code can be found on Github <a href = "https://github.com/RoyRin/APS"> https://github.com/RoyRin/APS </a> . If it is problematic to have my code online, I will take it down, but for the time being here it is. </blockquote>

          <p>Sadly I haven't made very much art in recent years, but here are some images of things I have made </p>
