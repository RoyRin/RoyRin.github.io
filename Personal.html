    <h4>Projects!</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <p>     Raspberry PI IOT : smart home project</p>
        <blockquote> To truly embrace living in NYC, I decided to go all in, and rent an apartment where my room did not have a window. You know, experience a thoroughly depressing existence for a year. But after committing to this, I realized that I hated it (obviously). In order to cope, and prevent my circadian rhythm from going completely haywire, I decided to make my Raspberry Pi control my sound and lights system. I will soon post a project description of how I went about this - in the off-chance someone is interested.</blockquote>
         <p>     Physics Simulations: </p>
         <blockquote> Some of projects : simulating a chaotic N-body system of planets orbiting with RK-4 and Symplectic integrators on Hamiltonian equations; Modelling chaotic behaviours; Simulating projection of water out of a fountain; Particle in a Box; Optical Tweezers/Trapping graphic and calculation. Here is the github to the majority of my computational physics simulations: <a href="https://github.com/RoyRin/Computational_Physics_2016"> enjoy! </a>.</blockquote>
          <p>     Code in CS classes: </p>
            <blockquote>     I wrote a lot of code for my Operating Systems class with Professor Hubertus Franke: we built a Linker, Scheduler, Virtual Memory Manager, and IO Scheduler from scratch in C++ (~25 hours each, with the exception of the IO scheduler which was ~7 hrs). I also wrote a LOT of code for my Algorithmic Problem Solving class with Professor John Zhang. The class website is <a href = "cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring17/CSCI-UA.0480-004/"> here</a> and I did every homework assignment in Java. I'm proud of the work that I did for both of these classes, but presumably the homework assignments don't change, and APS is literally a competitive programming class, so I think it would be ill-advised to put solutions on the internet. </blockquote>
